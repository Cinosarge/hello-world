# hello-world

University student in search for inspiration. I'm picky and dislike vegetables.

20.08.2020 I like vegetables, that was a lie. Also, today I'm gonna watch a Python tutorial about making videogames. I don't know Python but I don't think it's going to be an issue either. Do you know Python was created in 1991? Crazy! I've made some sample videogames using Unity during a course at uni but I know little or nothing about graphics. This is the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POelpwwqxek.
